# Handwritten-Amharic-character-Dataset
I have prepared this dataset by collecting the handwriting of individuals from different perspectives meaning different age ranges, level of education and right and left handed persons. I given them a form prepared to take their handwriting and I developed an algorithm to crop individual characters after scanned copy is given for the algorithm. The size is 28 x 28. It includes the 34 base characters.
